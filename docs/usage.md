title: ifpd usage
---

`ifpd` functionalities can be accessed in two different ways: through an in-built web [interface]({{ site.baseurl }}/interface) that is run with [`ifpd_serve`]({{ site.baseurl }}/scripts#ifpd_serve), or through an ensemble of back-end [scripts]({{ site.baseurl }}/scripts).

The interface has the advantage of removing any requirement for computational skills. Instead, to properly run the script and set up the whole environment, a user would need to have basic BASH skills.

We also provide a number of examples, related to both interface and scripts, in the corresponding [examples page]({{ site.baseurl }}/examples).
